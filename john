Create a complete, fully functional Minecraft hacked client similar to Vape V4. The client must include:

**Core Architecture:**
- JNI (Java Native Interface) integration for performance-critical modules (ESP rendering, movement prediction, packet handling)
- Self-injecting DLL/launcher window that automatically attaches to running Minecraft Java Edition (1.8.9 - 1.21 support)
- Modular plugin system with hot-reload capability
- Obfuscation bypass for modern Minecraft versions and anti-cheat systems

**Injection Window UI (Modern, Vape-like):**
- Glassmorphism design with blur effects, acrylic backdrops, neon accents
- Dark theme with customizable color schemes (purple/pink default like Vape)
- Smooth animations (0.3s ease-in-out transitions)
- Resizable draggable window with snap-to-edge functionality
- Click-through mode toggle for gameplay

**Essential Modules (All fully implemented):**
KillAura (rotation, CPS control, auto-block) Velocity (horizontal/vertical reduction, angle prediction) Flight (vanilla+, creative, static, smooth) Speed (bhop, strafe, lowhop, onground) ESP (2D/3D tracers, boxes, health bars, nametags) NoFall (edge cases, packet-based) Criticals (mini, full, bypass modes) AutoClicker (randomized CPS, jitter) Reach (block/player range extension) KillAura (multi-target, FOV control, priority system) Scaffold (tower, diagonals, legit mode)





**Technical Requirements:**
- Native rendering engine using LWJGL/OpenGL for overlays (60+ FPS)
- Packet interception/modification (Forge/Vanilla protocol support)
- Mixin-based injection for Forge/Fabric compatibility
- Anti-detection: randomization, humanization, toggle delays
- Config system (JSON profiles, cloud sync capability)
- Keybind system with conflict resolution

**Code Structure:**
├── src/main/java/ │ ├── injector/ (JNI loader, process attachment) │ ├── ui/ (ImGui/LWJGL3 custom renderer) │ ├── modules/ (all cheats categorized) │ ├── events/ (event bus system) │ ├── utils/ (math, rendering, packet utils) │ └── manager/ (module/config manager) ├── native/ (C++ JNI libs for performance) └── configs/ (default profiles)





**Deliverables:**
1. Complete source code with build instructions (Gradle/Maven)
2. Pre-compiled executable with injection window
3. Full documentation for customization
4. 5 example configs (PvP, Crystal, Bypass, Crystal, Movement)
5. Video demo script matching Vape V4 visual quality

**Quality Standards:**
- 144+ FPS performance impact <5%
- Bypass modern servers (Hypixel, Mineplex)
- Pixel-perfect Vape V4 UI recreation
- Zero crashes during 24hr stress test
- Clean, readable code with comments

Make it production-ready and indistinguishable from commercial clients.
